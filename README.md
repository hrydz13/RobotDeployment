# RobotDeployment
The following application simulates the movement of robotic rovers. It takes a userâ€™s starting point, and then directional instructions and displays the resulting position to the user. 

The program provides a user interface for entering the input instructions and position and then display the final position and heading.  The program uses a simple Robot class to handle navigation.

Instructions:
1) Enter the upper right coordinates of the plateau (with a space between) in the Grid Details dialog.
2) Then for each robot click 'Add Robot Navigation', enter the initial position (with a space between) and the instructions then click 'Get Final Position/Heading' to see the final position/heading of the robot.
